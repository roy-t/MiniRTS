    "# Generating Asteroids\n",
    "After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lctXaT9pxA0) I've become inspired to procedurally generate my own asteroids. I became even more intrigued when the video showed me how to combine functions to give such interesting results. However explaining how it works to friends and colleageus proved to be difficult. That's why I've decided to compile the technique in a Juypter Notebook. You can find the original notebook at [github](https://github.com/roy-t/MiniRTS/tree/master/Notebooks) as well as compute shaders in which I have implemented these techhniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## First things first\n",
    "Before generating asteroids I need several helper functions to plot the data. The main idea is that we have a line made up of many points, and we're going to write and combine functions that alter the height of each point based on their distance from the origin. We then generalize this idea to a circle. Here altering the height means placing the point further away from the center in the direction of the normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of these helper functions is not important right now, as long as you get the idea of what we're trying to accomplish."

We can smooth these transitions using the techniques described [here](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/smin/smin.htm). Note that beacuse we use a polynomal smoothing algorithm there's no beginning or end to the smoothing (as you would have with a simple `lerp`) so our whole circle becomes slightly larger as a result."
